# Software Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java projects developed during my Software Engineering course.  
Each project applies key principles of software design patterns, software architecture, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

|:--|:--|:--|
| **Bank** | Banking system to manage customers, personal and corporate accounts. | OOP, Class Design, Encapsulation |
| **Composite** | Item store for managing collections of Books and CDs. | Composite Pattern, XML Reader |
| **Minesweeper** | Classic Minesweeper game implementation. | MVC Architecture, Event Handling |
| **MVC** | Book Manager desktop app for managing a collection of books. | MVC Pattern, JavaFX |
| **Observer** | News broadcasting system to notify registered components of new updates. | Observer Pattern |
| **Observer Test Class** | Unit tests for the Observer pattern implementation. | JUnit Testing |
| **Reflection** | Application for reconstructing and analyzing Java classes at runtime. | Java Reflection API |
